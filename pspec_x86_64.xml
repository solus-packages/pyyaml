        <Summary xml:lang="en">Pyython YAML binding</Summary>
        <Description xml:lang="en">YAML is a data serialization format designed for human readability and interaction with scripting languages.

PyYAML is a YAML parser and emitter for the Python programming language.

PyYAML features

a complete  YAML 1.1 parser. In particular, PyYAML can parse all examples from the specification. The parsing algorithm is simple enough to be a reference for YAML parser implementors.
Unicode support including UTF-8/UTF-16 input/output and \u escape sequences.
low-level event-based parser and emitter API (like SAX).
high-level API for serializing and deserializing native Python objects (like DOM or pickle).
support for all types from the  YAML types repository. A simple extension API is provided.
both pure-Python and fast LibYAML-based parsers and emitters.
relatively sensible error messages.
